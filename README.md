# AC-Calendar
Add Animal Crossing villager birthdays to a new iCal file or a new Google Calendar.

In order to use the Google Calendar functionality you must add a credentials.json file obtained by enabling the Google Calendar API. This can be done quickly by following the instructions on this page: https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python.

In config.txt, enable Google Calendar and iCal functionality by setting their respective fields to 1. Disable by setting them to any other value.

timezones.txt contains a list of accepted timezones for Google Calendar.
